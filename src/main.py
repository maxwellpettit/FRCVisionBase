Description: This script uses a generated CV2 pipeline to process a camera
             stream and publish results to NetworkTables.  This script is
             designed to work on the FRCVision Raspberry Pi image.

Comments:    This script should be uploaded to the Raspberry Pi using the
             FRCVision web console.  Navigate to the "Application" tab and
             select the "Uploaded Python file" option.  The vision directory
             should be manually uploaded to the /home/pi/ directory of the
             Raspberry Pi.
